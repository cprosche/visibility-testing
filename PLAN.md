# Satellite Visibility Testing Framework - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A multi-language testing framework for validating satellite visibility calculations across different implementations. The framework provides shared test cases, automated validation, performance benchmarking, and CI/CD integration.

## Architecture Principles

### Core Components
1. **Test Data Repository**: Language-agnostic test cases in JSON format
2. **Implementation Modules**: Individual language implementations with standardized interfaces
3. **Test Orchestrator**: Coordinates test execution across all implementations
4. **Validation Engine**: Compares results with configurable tolerances
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing via GitHub Actions

### Design Goals
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new language implementations
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent test cases across all implementations
- **Transparency**: Clear result comparison and diff reporting
- **Performance**: Benchmark and compare execution speed
- **Automation**: Full CI/CD integration for continuous validation

## Phase 2: Reference Implementation
**Goal**: Create reference implementations to generate ground truth

### Python Libraries to Test
1. **Skyfield** - Primary reference (most accurate, well-maintained)
2. **sgp4** - Pure Python SGP4 implementation
3. **PyEphem** - Legacy but widely used

### Tasks
- [x] Set up Python implementation structure
  - Shared infrastructure: input parser, output formatter, test runner
  - Library-specific modules for each SGP4 package
  - Dependencies: skyfield, sgp4, pyephem, numpy, pytest
- [x] Create Docker images for each Python implementation
  - Dockerfile for python-skyfield (based on python:3.11-slim)
  - Dockerfile for python-sgp4
  - requirements.txt for reproducible dependencies
- [x] Implement Skyfield-based calculator (primary reference)
  - Satellite position from TLE
  - Observer-satellite geometry
  - Visibility windows (elevation > threshold)
  - Azimuth, elevation, range, range rate
- [x] Implement sgp4 library calculator
  - Same interface as Skyfield implementation
  - Compare results with Skyfield for validation
- [ ] Additional Python libraries (deferred - skyfield and sgp4 sufficient for reference)
- [x] Test Docker images
  - Verify all implementations run in containers
  - Test volume mounting for test-data access
  - Validate output from containerized runs
- [x] Generate reference results from Skyfield (primary ground truth)

- `/test-data/reference-results/*.json` - Ground truth outputs (from Skyfield) ✓

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (python-pyephem deferred)

**Actual Deliverables**:
- **python-skyfield**: Fully functional reference implementation
  - Docker image: visibility-test/python-skyfield:latest
  - Generated reference results for all 10 test cases
  - Execution time: ~22s total (significantly slower due to high-precision calculations)
  - Performance note: ~80x slower than SGP4 implementations due to precession/nutation corrections and high-accuracy transformations - ideal for reference validation, not real-time use
  - Results: 5 visibility windows for ISS over NYC (001_iss_nyc)
- **python-sgp4**: Alternative implementation (coordinate transformation fixed)
  - Docker image: visibility-test/python-sgp4:latest
  - Execution time: ~0.04s average (45x faster than Skyfield)
  - ✅ **Fixed**: Proper TEME to ECEF transformation with GMST rotation implemented
  - Agreement with reference: 100% (10/10 test cases match window count)
  - Window detection now accurate, absolute position accuracy ~0.5-1° and ~5km
  - Status: Functional for visibility window detection
- **Key Achievement**: Multi-library testing successfully identified and fixed coordinate transformation issues in python-sgp4

  - Follow standardized Docker image naming convention
- [x] Configure dependencies/build system
  - Language-specific package files (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
  - Lock files for reproducible builds
- [x] Implement standardized interface
  - Input: Read JSON test cases from mounted volume
  - Processing: Calculate visibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Library availability**: Not all languages have mature SGP4 libraries
  - Mitigation: Start with proven ecosystems, document library gaps
- **Floating-point precision**: Different platforms may yield slightly different results
  - Mitigation: Generous tolerances, platform-specific expectations
- **CI resource limits**: GitHub Actions has time/resource constraints
  - Mitigation: Parallel execution, caching, test case prioritization

### Operational Risks
- **Test data staleness**: TLE data becomes outdated
  - Mitigation: Use synthetic/historical data, document test epoch
- **Breaking changes**: Library updates may change behavior
  - Mitigation: Pin dependencies, version testing
